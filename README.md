# ReactJS
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use ReactJS in my projects for the first time.
There were 6 Tasks - a new branch on each was created. 
Branch Task1 - creating a simple app using React (create react elements) displaying movies list. 
Branch Task2 - modyfing the app from Task1 by creating many small React components. 
Branch Task3 - creating a simple app displaying list of contacts (creating React components practice). 
Branch Task4 - creating a simple app - counter (using React component state and lifecycle). 
Branch Task5 - modyfing the app from Task3 (list of contacts) using JSX syntax. 
Branch Task6 - creating an app to search gifs using ES6 syntax.
